jojo
====

the 10 second blog-engine for hackers (in javascript).

Inspired heavily by [toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto)

I rewrote it because I was frustrated at not being able integrate with my current server without starting 2 servers.
As a result, jojo can create an [express](http://expressjs.com/) server
```
var app = require('jojo').createServer();
```

or you can use jojo as [express](http://expressjs.com/) middleware.
```
var app = require('express').createServer(),
    jojo = require('jojo');
app.use(jojo);
```

Getting started
===============
GitHub
------
This GitHub repo is a pre-boxed funtional blog. Run the two commands and you will have a blog running at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
```
git clone git://github.com/twolfson/jojo.git
node app.js // Server is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

NPM
---
jojo is available as an npm package and can be used in any node project as such. This method is not as suggested since none of the views are set up.
```
npm install jojo
```

Configuring jojo
================
jojo was built to use express settings for the majority of its configuration. This means you can update jojo's configuration as you do with express:
```
app.set('jojo settingA', true);
app.settings['jojo settingB'] = true;
```

Default settings
----------------
```
// Base URL used by jojo for all blog posts
// (i.e. http://localhost:8080/ will be an index page containing summaries of recent blog posts.)
app.set('jojo basepath', '/');

// Directory where articles are read from
app.set('jojo articles', 'articles');

// View file used to render page that summarizes recent blog posts
app.set('jojo index view', 'pages/index');

// View file used to render page each blog post
app.set('jojo article view', 'pages/article');

// View file used to render RSS feed for blog
app.set('jojo rss view', 'xml');

// Data parser used for data at the head of each blog file
app.set('jojo data parser', 'json');

// Formatter to use while reading blog content
app.set('jojo formatter', 'showdown');
```
